# CSC111
Coursework from CSC 111 (Fall 2014) at UVic.

This course focused on teaching programming fundamentals using C and Eclipse. Unfortunately, I lost some assignments when my old hard drive got wiped, so this repository is not comprehensive.

Some topics covered included
- the C programming language
- programming with real-world engineering
- imperative programming
- variables, data types, statements, control structures
- functions, parameter passing mechanisms, expressions
- data structures, files, pointers
- storage allocation, elementary searching and sorting
- recursion, encapsulation, modularity
- incremental development
- testing and debugging.
